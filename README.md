## About

I’m a systems-minded developer and technologist building **calm, trustworthy tools** for people — especially in spaces where technology is often noisy, invasive, or poorly designed.

I founded **The Lumen Framework**, an ethics-first technology studio focused on thoughtful software, humane automation, and systems that respect privacy, agency, and mental wellbeing.

My work blends engineering, design, and long-term thinking — less about disruption, more about **quiet reliability**.

> *Light where it’s needed most.*

## The Lumen Framework

**The Lumen Framework (TLF)** is a small, values-led technology studio.  
We build tools that are:

- 🧭 **Ethics-first** — people over profit, always  
- 🌗 **Calm by design** — no dark patterns, no manipulation  
- 🔐 **Privacy-respecting** — local-first where possible  
- 🛠️ **Built to last** — maintainable, understandable systems  

Some projects are public. Some are internal. All are designed with care.

## Selected Work

- **TLF Core** — shared architecture, values, and design systems  
- **Home & Personal Automation** — local-first smart systems  
- **Media & Knowledge Tools** — self-hosted, user-controlled platforms  
- **Research & Prototyping** — AI, human-centred interfaces, calm UX  

(Names and implementations evolve — the philosophy doesn’t.)
